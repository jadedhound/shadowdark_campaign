**Knowledge and Skills.** Your character had some sort of background before they
decided to embark on their current adventure. The skills and knowledge they
learnt from such a history will be invaluable in the trials ahead.

_Whenever there is a situation where your skills can come in handy let the DM
know; it might just give you the edge you needed._
