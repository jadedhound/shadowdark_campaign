## Initiative

**Surprise.** The GM determines if any creatures (including player characters)
are unaware of each other. A creature who surprises another, takes one turn
before regular initiative takes places.

**Group Initiative.** Each side (players and their enemies) does their actions
together, with players acting first.

## Actions

Characters can take one action and move near on their turn, splitting up the
movement however they want.

Here are a list of actions you can do:

**Attack.** Melee attacks use melee weapons. Roll:

```
1d20 + your Strength for melee or Dexterity for ranged modifier + talent bonuses
```

You hit the target if your total is equal to or greater than its AC.

**Cast A Spell.** [Casting a spell](@/rules/spellcasting.md) takes one action.

**Dash.** Move your movement once again.

**Improvise.** Do an improvised action, such as swinging across a ravine on a
vine. The GM might determine it requires a stat check or attack roll.

**Multitask.** Characters can do small, parallel tasks on their turns, such as
standing up, speaking, activating a magic item, or quaffing a potion. This
doesn't typically use their action.

## Damage

When you hit a target with an attack or spell, you damage it. Roll

```
your weapon or spell's damage dice + relevant bonuses
```

The GM subtracts that amount from the target's hit points.

**Knockout.** You can choose to knock a creature unconscious instead of killing
it if you reduce it to 0 hit points.

**Critical Hit.** You deal a critical hit if you roll a natural 20 on an attack
roll or spellcasting check. For a _weapon_, double its damage dice on the
attack. For a _spell_, you may double one of its numerical effects.

## Terrain

Attacking or casting a spell on a creature that is hiding at least half its body
behind interposing terrain has disadvantage.

If you can't see a creature at all due to terrain, you can't target it.

Creatures can only move half the normal distance through terrain that hampers
free movement, such as ice or deep mud.

## Morale

Enemies who are reduced to half their number (or half their HP for a solo enemy)
flee if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom check. For large groups, the GM makes one check
with the leader's modifier.

## Death

A character who goes to 0 HP falls unconscious and is dying. A character who
goes above 0 HP wakes up and is no longer dying.

**Death Timer.** A dying character on their turn rolls

```
1d4 + their CON modifier (minimum 1 total)
```

They die in that many rounds unless healed or stabilized.

**Stabilize.** An intelligent being can give first aid to a dying creature at
close range. On a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, the target stops dying
(but is still unconscious).

**Death.** A character who perishes is retired from the game.
