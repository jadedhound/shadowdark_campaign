# Casting Spells

Casting a spell takes your action. Only characters with the spellcasting talent
can cast spells.

To cast a spell, make a spellcasting check by rolling **1d20 + your class' main
ability modifier**.

The DC to successfully cast a spell is **10 + the spell’s tier**.

## Results

If you succeed on your spellcasting check, the spell takes effect.

If you fail your spellcasting check, the spell does not take effect. You can’t
cast that spell again until you complete a rest.

## Critical Success

If you roll a natural 20 on your spellcasting check, you may double one of the
spell’s numerical effects. This remains in effect on a [focus](#focus) spell
until your next focus check.

## Critical Failure

If you roll a natural 1 on your spellcasting check, the spell does not take
effect. If it was a **focus** spell, the spell immediately ends (see pg. 50 for
more details on focus spells).

**Wizard Spell.** If the spell was a wizard spell, you can’t cast that spell
again until you successfully complete a rest. You must also roll on the
[Wild Magic](#wild-magic) table corresponding to the spell’s tier.

**Cleric Spell.** If the spell was a cleric spell, your deity is greatly
displeased and revokes its power. You can’t cast that spell again until you
complete ritualistic [penance](#Penance) to your deity and successfully complete
a rest.

## Penance

The GM determines the exact nature of the penance you must undertake based on
your deity and alignment.

Penance requires a holy quest, ritualistic atonement, or a material sacrifice
that you donate or destroy.

Inadequate or subversive penance (such as donating your sacrifice to a party
member) only displeases your deity further and makes the spell loss permanent.

# Spell Attributes

## Tiers

Spells are classified according to their tiers, which range from 1-5.

## Range

Range determines at what distance (close, near, or far) you can deliver the
spell’s effects.

Self range means you can only target yourself with the spell.

## Duration

Duration is how long the spell effects last. Spells can have an instant effect
or last for several turns, rounds, or longer.

See Focus for spells with a focus duration.

## Overlapping Effects

Ongoing effects of the same spell on the same target do not combine. The spell
with the most powerful effect takes precedence, such as the spell with the
longer remaining duration.

## Focus

Some spells last for as long as you focus. You can’t cast other focus spells
while focusing. You can end a focus spell at anytime.

To maintain focus, make a spellcasting check at the start of your turn as if you
were casting that spell.

**Success.** The spell remains in effect until the start of your next turn.

**Failure.** The spell ends. If you were focusing, you do not lose the ability
to cast that spell. However, if you critically fail on a check to maintain
focus, treat it as a standard [critical failure](#critical-failure).

If you take damage or become distracted while focusing (due to an earthquake,
for example), you must immediately make a spellcasting check to maintain focus.
