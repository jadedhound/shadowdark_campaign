## Overland

**Watches.** Days are split into 3 distinct sections: morning, afternoon and night.

**Travel.** Use one _watch_ to travel to an adjacent hex. Your group must succeed
on a DC 12 CON check to travel more than 2 hexes in a row.

**Navigation.** If the terrain is particularly hazardous, the DM might require you
to roll a group WIS check.

**Searching.** Search a hex to reveal any points of interest or secret features.

**Foraging.** Use one _watch_ to search for food in an approriate location, collecting
1d4 days worth of rations.

## Dungeon Delving

**Light and Darkness.** 

**Searching.** Use one _turn_ to reveal any non-obvious features of a location. Can only
be done with an active light source.

**Encounters.**
