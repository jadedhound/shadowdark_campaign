## Terminology

Ability scores describe your character in a numerical fashion, for instance the
higher your strength the more likely you will succeed at strength based tasks.

An ability is described with two terms: a score and a modifier. The ability
score is a number (usually from 3 to 18) and the [modifier](#modifiers) is a
smaller number, derived from the score (usually from -4 to +4), that we add and
subtract from [dice checks](@/misc/basics.md#checks).

## Determining Scores

Roll 3d6 (3 six sided dice and add the result) for each ability in order.

**Complete reroll.** If you donâ€™t have at least 1 ability score at or over 14,
then you can reroll the entire set.

**Swap.** You can swap an ability score with another, once. Ensure your highest
stat is in the one that your class requires most (see below).

| Class   | Required |
| ------- | -------- |
| Fighter | STR      |
| Thief   | DEX      |
| Cleric  | WIS      |
| Wizard  | INT      |
